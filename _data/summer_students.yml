  description: "I am a third year bachelor of science student at Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I also play on the women’s varsity soccer team. I aspire to work in the medical field one day as I find it to be very fulfilling. I am grateful to work in the Hansen He Lab this summer and I look forward to future projects."
